##DO NOT LIST MEMBERS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
+ Personal Privacy will be respected
+ In fact, Members will only be added if the pull request comes from the individual themselves.  That way each person can choose if they wish to be a private member or a public member. 
+ I will do my best, but if I cannot verify that the account making the pull request is the person who's information is being added I will not accept the pull request
+ If you wish to remove your name, send a pull request as well.  However since this is github keep in mind that this information will be in the commit history
